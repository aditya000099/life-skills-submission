# Tiny Habits

### Question 1

**In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?**

The idea that stood out to me the most was BJ Fogg's story about creating the pushup habit. He started with just two pushups after brushing his teeth. It was a small action, yet it showed how powerful tiny habits can be. It made me realise that big changes don't always need big efforts, they can start very small.

### Question 2

**How can you use B = MAP to make new habits easier? What are M, A, and P?**

B = MAP means

- Motivation
- Ability
- Prompt

According to this formula, a behavior happens when these three elements come together. To build a new habit, I can make the task simple and attach it to something I already do. For example, I want to keep learning new technical topics, so I would just set a daily alarm, that would remind me of doing a step to build a habit.

### Question 3

**Why is it important to celebrate after completing a habit?**

It is important to celebrate because it makes me feel good. When I feel good, I want to do the habit again. It helps me continue every day.

### Question 4

**In this video, what was the most interesting idea for you?**

The most interesting idea was that small improvement every day can make big results. Even 1% better each day can make a big difference later.

### Question 5

**What is the book's perspective about Identity?**

The book says habits should match our identity. For example, instead of saying “I want to learn more,” I say “I am a learner.” When I believe this, it is easier to learn.

### Question 6

**How can you make a habit easier to do?**

Make it easily accessible to me and increase its visibility around me. Like just changing my phone's wallpaper to something that depicts my habit that I want to build

### Question 7

**How can you make a habit harder to do?**

To stop a bad habit, I can make it harder. For example, keeping my smartphone in some other room, so I don't use smartphone as soon as I wake up.

### Question 8

**One habit I want to do more**

I want to build a regular reading habit and spend more time learning about system design.

### Question 9

**One habit I want to stop**

I want to reduce my screen time and avoid using my phone late night.
