# Focus Management

### Question 1: What is Deep Work?

Work done with full attention without any distractions is deep work. It also means avoiding less important task like reading mails, doom scrolling and more like these. Deep work saves a lot of time as it saves our distracted time.

Cal Newport says this type of focus is rare today, it makes you valuable in your career.


### Question 2: How to do deep work properly?

1. Take breaks - Avoid trying to concentrate all day. After **60 - 90 minutes** of intense work, take a serious break.
2. Avoiding interruptions - Move your phone to a different room. Instruct others not to bother you.
3. Establish a schedule - Do deep work every day at the same time. Your brain adjusts to it.
4. Put an end to checking phone - When working deeply, avoid checking your email or messages. You become distracted each time you switch.


### Question 3: How can I use this in my daily life?

1. Schedule deep work time daily. Best time woul dbe anytime after breakfast. Avoid distraction at this time.
2. Addingto above point, I usually feel my deep work time is just before sleep, that's the time when i feel most focused as I'm motivate dby the thought that I shoudl end my day with a productive note.
3. Storing phone in my bag or putting it on Airplane Mode.
4. Starting slow, If 1 hour seems excessive, begin with 25 minutes and work my way up.
5. Pre plan breaks for microtasks like emails reading, important updates to get from phone.


### Question 4: What are the dangers of social media?

1. Increased dopamine levels, making it harder for us to stay focused for longer times.
2. Adding a comparison syndrome like seeing everyone's happy moments makes us feel our life is boring.
3. Biggest asset of us especially at this time, the Time itself. We open phone for  2 minutes and end up scrolling until we realise we have been scrolling .
4. Reduced attention span making it harder to stay focused for longer times. These days short form content reduces the attention span.
